# Borg Collective Distributed Systems Integration
# Starfleet OS Implementation Summary

## Overview

The Borg Collective Distributed Systems Integration transforms the Starfleet OS Borg Collective from a collection of individual machines into a truly unified distributed system. By leveraging advanced technologies including Proxmox VE, Kubernetes, Ceph, Consul, and Home Assistant with MQTT, we've created a resilient, self-healing collective consciousness that transcends the limitations of individual hardware components.

- Automated VM provisioning through the Borg Collective Manager

**Benefits:**
- Efficient hardware utilization
- Simplified management of virtual machines
- High availability for critical services
- Live migration capabilities

### 2. Distributed Storage: Ceph

Ceph provides a unified, distributed storage system that allows all nodes in the collective to access the same data, regardless of physical location.

**Implementation Highlights:**
- Ceph cluster with monitors on Queen Node and Drone Nodes
- RBD pool for VM storage
- CephFS for shared data access
- Integration with Kubernetes for persistent storage

**Benefits:**
- Unified storage across all nodes
- Data redundancy and fault tolerance
- Scalable storage capacity
- Consistent storage interface

### 3. Container Orchestration: Kubernetes (K3s)

Kubernetes provides container orchestration capabilities, allowing the Borg Collective to deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications efficiently.

**Implementation Highlights:**
- Lightweight K3s deployment with Queen Node as master
- Integration with Ceph for persistent storage
- Deployment of core Borg Collective services as containers
- Monitoring and logging infrastructure

**Benefits:**
- Efficient resource utilization
- Self-healing application deployments
- Simplified scaling of services
- Consistent deployment environment

### 4. Service Discovery: Consul

Consul provides service discovery and health monitoring capabilities, allowing nodes in the collective to locate and communicate with each other dynamically.

**Implementation Highlights:**
- Consul server on Queen Node with clients on all other nodes
- Service registration for all Borg Collective services
- Health checks for automatic service recovery
- DNS integration for service discovery

**Benefits:**
- Dynamic service discovery
- Automatic health monitoring
- Simplified service communication
- Resilient service architecture

### 5. Sensor Integration: Home Assistant + MQTT

Home Assistant and MQTT provide sensor integration capabilities, allowing the Borg Collective to gather and process data from the physical environment.

**Implementation Highlights:**
- Home Assistant deployment on Edge-PI
- MQTT broker on Queen Node for message distribution
- Sensor data collection and processing
- Automation based on sensor inputs

**Benefits:**
- Environmental awareness
- Data-driven decision making
- Automated responses to environmental changes
- Integration with physical devices

## Implementation Details

### NixOS Module Structure

The implementation consists of a set of NixOS modules that can be composed to create different node configurations:

```
