# Implement LCARS Boot Sequence, Login System, and Holodeck Mode

## Description

This pull request implements three key components of Starfleet OS:

1. **LCARS Boot Sequence**: A visually consistent Star Trek-inspired boot experience
2. **LCARS Login System**: A secure, LCARS-themed authentication system
3. **Holodeck Mode**: A secure, isolated simulation environment

## Changes Made

### LCARS Boot Sequence
- Added NixOS modules for LCARS boot splash and Plymouth theme integration
- Created package for LCARS Plymouth themes
- Implemented boot animation and sound support
- Added systemd integration for boot sequence

### LCARS Login System
- Added NixOS modules for LCARS login manager and role-based access control
- Created package for LCARS login manager
- Implemented authentication backend with PAM integration
- Added support for biometric and voice authentication

### Holodeck Mode
- Added NixOS modules for Holodeck mode and containerization system
- Created packages for Holodeck simulation framework, container management, templates, UI, assets, and controls
- Implemented simulation templates for starship bridge and engineering lab
- Added command-line tools for managing simulations

### Documentation
- Added detailed implementation documents for all components
- Created testing guide for OptiPlex bridge hardware
- Updated implementation summary

## Testing Done

- Verified module syntax and structure
- Tested package builds
- Validated implementation against design requirements

## Next Steps

- Test the implementation on OptiPlex bridge hardware
- Generate test ISOs for different node types
- Integrate with existing components
- Update user and developer documentation
- Deploy to test environment
